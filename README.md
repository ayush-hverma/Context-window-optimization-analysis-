The Context Window Optimization Analysis aims to evaluate and optimize the way text is divided into chunks for processing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. This analysis focuses on three main objectives:

## Chunking Methods: 
It compares different strategies for chunking text, such as fixed-length chunks, sentence-based chunking, and paragraph-based chunking. Each method presents unique trade-offs in terms of semantic coherence, token efficiency, and context preservation.

## Evaluation Metrics: 
The study measures key metrics such as semantic coherence (how well the meaning is preserved within and between chunks), context overlap (how much context is shared between adjacent chunks), and token efficiency (the effectiveness of token usage in representing meaningful content).

## Optimization: 
The analysis explores the balance between chunking efficiency and semantic integrity. By testing various chunking methods and analyzing the resulting text chunks, the project aims to find the optimal strategy for both processing speed and contextual understanding.

This project provides valuable insights for optimizing the chunking process in NLP systems, enhancing the performance of tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval.
